  <h1 class="white">Asian Museum Visit</h1>
  <h3 class="white">One weekend, I went to the MIA. The MIA had a wide variety of Asian art, including statues, paintings, pottery, and even a recreation of a Japanese tea house! This is my account of this amazing trip.
</h3>
  <h2 class="white">What I Saw</h2>
  <p class="white">The first thing I saw on my trip to the MIA was a pair 
    of 7-foot tall statues guarding the entrance. 
    After that, a miniature statue of Buddha. 
    Although most of the items at the exhibit 
    were pieces of pottery, there were some quite 
    interesting things on display, like a 
    decorative suit of armor. There were plenty of 
    8-fold walls too. The exhibit also showed how a 
    Japanese house is arranged. Its general shape is 
    a courtyard surrounded by a long wall divided up 
    into three sections. The exhibit also contained a 
    model of a house where the owners would drink tea. 
    Like Japanese tradition, the floor had a large mat 
    in the middle where people would sit down to drink. 
    There was also an indent in the wall dedicated to 
    displaying paintings. All of this is only the tip 
    of the iceberg of what I saw. Scroll down to see a 
    list of even more of what I saw.
